## **Upgrading**

{% hint style="success" %}
**Upgrade process using the config import tool**

Using the config import tool you can easily upgrade to a clean new installation, and migrate all your settings.

**Steps to start with a clean installation:**

* unpack v23 to a new folder and run,   
* enter your Gunthy wallet address in the wizard, select "other" as exchange and save changes.   
* then go to _Profile_ &gt; _Import settings_ and select the parts from your old config to import.
{% endhint %}

There are no breaking config changes for this version, in case you are upgrading from v22.

New strategy parameters are automatically merged into your strategies, as soon as you login to the browser interface.

In case you are upgrading from an older version than v22, refer to the changelogs of previous versions for instructions, or start with a fresh installation.
