# Import settings

Use the built-in import tool to import parts of config.js or autoconfig.json files, for example when you want to use a strategy from a config another user has shared.

To change them, go to [**Global settings**](http://localhost:5000/globalsettings) &gt; **Import settings**

Just upload a valid config file, then select the parts you want to use in your bot.
