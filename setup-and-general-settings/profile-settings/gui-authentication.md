# GUI authentication

Besides password security, you can optionally use two factor authentication.

Manage your authentication settings on [**Profile**](http://localhost:5000/profile) **&gt; GUI authentication**.

{% hint style="info" %}
When you enabled 2FA, you'll be asked to enter a one time code next to your password the next time you login to the Gunbot interface.
{% endhint %}
