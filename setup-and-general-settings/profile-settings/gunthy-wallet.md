# Gunthy wallet

A Gunbot license is always registered to a unique wallet address, this is the same address that you've registered and hold a Gunthy token balance on.

Enter your Gunthy wallet address on [**Profile** ](http://localhost:5000/profile)**&gt; Gunthy Wallet**.

{% hint style="success" %}
If you do a clean installation, the welcome wizard will ask you to enter the wallet address, along with the needed data to connect to an exchange.
{% endhint %}
