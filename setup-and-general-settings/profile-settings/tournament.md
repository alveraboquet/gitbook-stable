# Tournament

To participate in an internal tournament, go to **Profile &gt; Tournament**.

{% hint style="success" %}
Read more about internal tournaments: [https://tournament.gunthy.org/](https://tournament.gunthy.org/)
{% endhint %}

Make sure to give your bot a unique user name, this will only appear on the tournament leader board.

If you run multiple bot instances and want all of them to participate in a tournament, number your instance nicknames like this: TraderNickname\_1, TraderNickname\_2, TraderNickname\_3. They will automatically get aggregated to a single leaderboard entry at the end of the tournament.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can force submitting trading results to the tournament board by opening the [PNL page](http://localhost:5000/pnl), selecting a single pair \(not the "all" option\) and waiting a minute.
